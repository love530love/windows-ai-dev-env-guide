## I. Isolation Goals  

1. **Eliminate global dependency conflicts**  
   Install build tools such as `poetry`, `uv`, `hatch`, `pipenv`, and `virtualenv` into project-isolated environments to avoid build failures caused by version inconsistencies between tools in different projects.  

2. **Ensure project reproducibility**  
   Each project comes with a localized toolchain, independent of external global environments. Building results can be reproduced immediately after pulling the code.  

3. **Support offline and rapid deployment**  
   Localized toolchains can be packaged and cached, enabling one-click installation in offline environments.  


## II. Isolation Solution  

### 2.1 Recommended Workflow  

1. **Install basic tools in the Conda main environment**  
   ```powershell
   conda activate I:/DevTools/Anaconda/py311
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install poetry virtualenv pipenv uv hatch
   ```  
   > This step is only for "preparing templates". Subsequent projects will use the copied `.venv_template/`.  


2. **Create `.venv` in the project directory and copy the toolchain**  
   ```powershell
   cd MyAiProject
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install poetry virtualenv pipenv uv hatch
   ```  
   > Alternatively, directly copy the pre-built `.venv_template/` to the project root directory and activate it.  


3. **Lock tool versions**  
   ```bash
   poetry lock
   pip freeze > .venv/requirements-tools.txt
   ```  


### 2.2 Example Directory Structure  
```
MyAiProject/
â”œâ”€â”€ .venv/                          # Localized virtual environment (core isolation unit)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Scripts/                    # Executable scripts directory
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ python.exe              # Project-specific interpreter
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pip.exe                 # Isolated package management tool
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Lib/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ site-packages/          # Localized toolchain storage
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ poetry/             # In-project poetry tool
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ uv/                 # In-project uv tool
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ hatch/              # In-project hatch tool
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ pipenv/             # In-project pipenv tool
â”œâ”€â”€ .venv-tools-requirements.txt    # Toolchain version lock file (ensures reproducibility)
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml                  # Poetry project configuration (dependency definition)
â””â”€â”€ README.md                       # Toolchain activation and usage instructions
```  


## III. Practical Tips  

- **Template-based one-click copy**  
  Compress the built `.venv` directory into `venv_template.zip`. In new projects, unzip it and rename it to `.venv`, then run the following command to fix path dependencies:  
  ```powershell
  .venv\Scripts\python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```  


- **Offline installation support**  
  Download toolchain dependency packages in advance to support deployment in offline environments:  
  ```powershell
  # Download dependencies to local cache
  pip download -r .venv-tools-requirements.txt -d ./offline_packages
  
  # Offline installation (execute when no network is available)
  pip install --no-index --find-links ./offline_packages -r .venv-tools-requirements.txt
  ```  


- **Avoid permission issues**  
  Ensure the `.venv` directory path contains no special characters and is not in a system-restricted path (e.g., `C:\Program Files`). It is recommended to place it in a project-specific directory (e.g., `I:\Projects\MyAiProject`).  


## IV. Summary  

- **Core isolation logic**: Build tools are shifted from "globally shared" to "project-private", with tool versions managed alongside project code.  
- **Key to reproducibility**: Lock tool versions via `requirements-tools.txt` and ensure environment consistency by copying the `.venv` directory.  
- **Practical value**: Solves classic issues such as "tool conflicts between projects on the same machine" and "build failures after device replacement".
